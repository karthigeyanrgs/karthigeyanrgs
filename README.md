#### Hello!
### Hello! 
### Good to see you here!

I am Karthigeyan. I initially found my feet with fluid flow simulations, turbulence modeling, and mathematical modeling for socio-economic causes.

My master's has inculcated in me the knowledge essential to create or understand tools that help to simulate, analyze or benchmark through them. Catering to my fascination for mathematics, I undertook projects and courses that were both math-intensive and challenging on a personal front.

This derived knowledge helped me create stabilized and consistent tools with their results. I had worked on one such tool to model unemployment with a socio-economic aspect as part of my master thesis.
