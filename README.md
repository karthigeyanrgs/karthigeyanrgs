## Hello!

### Good to see you here!

My professional endeavours have led me to be a fierce communicator and optimization advocate who finds home in a challenging environment which doesnâ€™t entertain mediocrity or monotonicity. I find comfort in working on long term complex projects which lead to substantial growth of the company and in turn the world.

I am currently motivated to bring robotics simulations closer to reality. Through Nvidia Isaac Sim, we are translating real world scenarios to the simulation framework and creating the near-perfect digital twins of the bots and their environments. I have eggs in several other baskets, namely:

1. I automated the end-to-end upgrade process of linux kernel for Nvidia Jetson boards. This effort involved customizing device-tree files, tweaking configurations, writing bash scripts, referring datasheets and translating it to machine code. Through this project, I have understood the nitty gritties of building an operating system and customizing to oneâ€™s advantage.

2. By enabling an entire pipeline of running simulations on x86 systems, eliminating the need for a bot or arm equivalent systems, the simulations can be performed in the matter of seconds. I have gained a deeper understanding of build systems, optimizing their build times and gained expertise in handling multiple build environments. Be it docker or Kubernetes, I will be able to write the instruction set. Do you favor a microservice based deployment? I can help you with that.

3. I have integrated several ad-hoc hardware that would be essential for the safe navigation of the bot. Be it a trolley load cell, tablet or CAN bus, I have worked on implementing the interface. Through this experience, I have gained knowledge in the world of networks, writing firmware and getting the most juice out of every operating edge device.

4. I have supervised the development of a complete CI/CD pipeline, which involved understanding the intricacies of software, inter-application communication and delivering solutions to a diverse operating system. I led the team to write OS agnostic software which is devoid of memory leaks, performance throttling and sub-optimal program.

Past work:
I started with core mechanical disciplines, finding my foot in fluid simulations with sufficient mathematical training. Delving deeper, I took up an interesting challenge of designing kinetic equations for unemployment using transport equations. I moved to non-technical line of work starting ground up - Community and Growth manager, Customer Success Engineer to becoming the Head of Growth and now exploring software.
